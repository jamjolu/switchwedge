SwitchWedge - A Windows ability switch enhancer for any switch interface

SwitchWedge can enhance accessibility to many programs and websites, and it can greatly increase the utility of common switch interfaces such as keyboard emulators like the DJ Switch Interface Pro, adapted mice, or adapted joysticks/gamepads. SwitchWedge supports up to 5 switches, and offers enhancements like mouse control, spot scanning and other features that the typical switch interface itself does not offer.

SwitchWedge is an AutoHotKey script that is also compiled to a Windows executable. This repository contains:
1. sw.ini -- This is a settings file for SwitchWedge and must reside in the same directory as SwitchWedge.exe or SwitchWedge.ahk
2. SwitchWedge.ahk -- The AutoHotKey source file - sw.ini, SwitchWedge_.jpg, SwitchWedgeHelp.html should be in the same directory at runtime
3. SwitchWedge.exe -- The Windows executable - sw.ini, SwitchWedge_.jpg, SwitchWedgeHelp.html should be in the same directory at runtime
