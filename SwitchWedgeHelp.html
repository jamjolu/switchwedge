    <p style="text-align: center;">Updated&nbsp; May 31, 2014</p>
    <p style="text-align: center;">New bug fixes - keyboard commands are now based on the Alt-key combos rather than the Win-key combos to avoid conflicts with Windows.</p>
    <p style="text-align: center;">Look for how-to videos soon!</p>

    <p><strong>What Does SwitchWedge Do</strong>?</p>
    <p>SwitchWedge can enhance accessibility to many programs and websites, and
      it can greatly increase the utility of common switch interfaces such as
      keyboard emulators like the DJ Switch Interface Pro, adapted mice, or
      adapted joysticks/gamepads. SwitchWedge supports up to 5 switches, and
      offers enhancements like mouse control, spot scanning and other features
      that the typical switch interface itself does not offer.</p>

    <p>The leftmost column of labels describes what the row of button(s) to the
      right are for.&nbsp; The topmost label, "<strong>Operating As</strong>,"
      defines an operating mode for the two leftmost <strong>Switch Triggers</strong>
      (switch interface inputs.)&nbsp; These operating modes&nbsp; provide the
      active features that SwitchWedge offers, and they pertain only to the two
      leftmost triggers as denoted by the box surrounding those buttons. You can
      choose from the <strong>Switch Trigger</strong> drop down menus which
      standard switch interface inputs, adapted mouse inputs, or joystick
      buttons will act to initiate the actions of SwitchWedge. You can also
      choose 'none' as a Switch Trigger to define that trigger as
      inactive.&nbsp; The other three <strong>Switch Triggers</strong>
      (rounding out the other three switch inputs on many switch interfaces) can
      be redefined to send key sequences as described below in the section: <a
        href="#set%20custom%20msgs"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Define
          Custom Key Sequences</span></a>. The row of drop down menus labeled <strong>Key
        Seq. Sent</strong> represents keystrokes, custom key sequences, or mouse
      clicks that are sent to the active application as a result of a user
      hitting a <strong>Switch Trigger</strong>. Depending on the operating
      mode, the <strong>Key Seq. Sent</strong> menus may be hidden. For
      example, in <strong>Spot Scan</strong> mode, because only mouse click is
      sent during spot scanning the <strong>Key Seq. Sent</strong> options are
      hidden for leftmost 2 triggers.</p>
    <p>Whenever you change operating modes SwitchWedge will open a help window
      to remind you of how to use that mode.</p>
    <p>Whenever you change any of SwitchWedge's settings those changes are
      automatically saved in a file that accompanies SwitchWedge called, sw.ini.</p>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <p><a id="operating Modes"><strong>What are the different operating modes</strong>?</a></p>
    <p>1. - <strong>Single Switch</strong> scanning - the first switch
      activation repeatedly sends a user defined keystroke associated with the
      leftmost&nbsp; switch trigger to the active application at the <strong>Scan
        Rate</strong> (in seconds) to highlight items. A second activation of
      the same switch sends the next-to-leftmost user defined keystroke to the
      active application to select the highlighted item. Either of the leftmost
      triggers will initiate and control the scan sequence. In many browsers a
      sequence of Tab keys will move the focus around clickable links on a page
      and Spacebar will select the&nbsp; link that has the focus and follow it
      just the same as clicking on it,</p>
    <p>2. - <strong>Two Switch</strong> scanning-&nbsp; The user uses separate
      switches, one to issue a sequence to highlight an item and one to select
      an item.</p>
    <p>3. - <strong>One Click</strong> - the switch activation sends a <span style="font-style: italic;">click</span>
      to a user defined target. <span style="font-style: italic;">Subsequent
        switch hits are ignored during the</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">Mask
        Time</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> interval that follows the
        initial trigger</span>. Either of the leftmost triggers can initiate the
      click action. The click target is defined by hovering the mouse cursor
      over the intended target and pressing the Alt-1 key combo. (Press and hold
      the Win key, and then tap the 1 key.) This mode is good for moderating a
      user who may hit a switch multiple times when once is enough, like in a
      PowerPoint slide show.</p>
    <p> 4. - <strong>Two Click</strong> - The trigger sends a click at a first
      target and then <span style="font-style: italic;">after</span> the <strong>Scan
        Rate</strong> interval, a second click to a second target. <span style="font-style: italic;">Subsequent
        triggers are ignored during the</span> Mask Time <span style="font-style: italic;">interval
        that follows the initial trigger</span>. Either of the leftmost triggers
      can initiate the click action. The first click target is defined by
      hovering the mouse cursor over the intended target and pressing the Alt-1
      key combo, and the second click target is recorded similarly using the
      Alt-2 key combo. This mode is good for creating a cause/effect activity
      for a user using something like YouTube where the switch hit starts a
      video and and the automatic second click will pause it after the Scan Rate
      interval, and hopefully encouraging the user to keep the activity going by
      hitting their switch when the activity stops.</p>
    <p>5. -<strong> Scan Mouse 1</strong> - This mode offers users a good deal
      of control over the mouse cursor in any program. The trigger initiates a
      sequence of tool tips that appear near the mouse cursor at the <strong>Scan
        Rate</strong> which describe mouse actions - either mouse moves: up,
      right, down, and left; or mouse clicks: click, double click, right click,
      and drag. The mouse cursor will move at a rate defined by the <strong>Mouse
        Speed</strong> drop down menu where <span style="font-style: italic;">smaller</span>
      numbers yield a faster movement. 100 is a good medium slow speed.&nbsp;
      Either of the leftmost triggers can initiate scan mouse.</p>
    <p>6. - <strong>Scan Mouse 2</strong> - Same as Scan Mouse 1 but adds the
      possibility of auditory support for scanning by copying the tool tip text
      to the clipboard where a helper program like TTSReader, SpeakEasy, Orato,
      ClipSpeak, or Deskbot can read it out loud. Free clipboard text-to-speech
      are easily found on the Internet. Either of the leftmost triggers can
      initiate scan mouse.</p>
    <p>7. - <strong>Spot Scan 1 and 2</strong> -Spot scan allows you to define
      up to 10 hot spots that will be scanned in numerical order. Identify the
      first hotspot by hovering the mouse cursor over the first target and
      capturing the mouse position with the Alt-1 key combo. The second hotspot
      is recorded with the Alt-2 combo, and so forth up to the tenth hotspot
      that is recorded with the Alt-0 key combo. Use Alt-z to clear the spot
      scan sequence. <strong>Key Trigger</strong> defines which key is used to
      start or stop scanning which occurs at the <strong>Scan Rate</strong>.
      Either leftmost trigger can start the scan which sequentially positions
      the mouse cursor over each spot at the scan rate. A second trigger stops
      the scan and sends a mouse click to the last mouse position. <strong>Scan
        Spot 2</strong> allows you to enter auditory cue text for each spot. The
      cues are spoken by a helper clipboard text-to-speech application like
      TTSReader,&nbsp; Orato or Deskbot which must be active before beginning
      spot scanning.</p>
    <p>8. -&nbsp; <strong>Remap Mode</strong> - sends whatever message you pick
      from the drop Key Seq. Sent down menus, including a user defined <strong>Custom
        Key Sequence</strong> as described below. You can set a Mask interval as
      well.&nbsp; </p>
	  <p>9. -&nbsp; <strong>Click List Mode</strong> - sends a click to one of up to 10 targets in a list. Each target is recorded in the same manner as with spot scanning. Hover the cursor over a target and use Alt-1 to record the position of the first target. Do the same using Alt-2, Alt-3, and so forth to record each additional target up to Alt-0 for the tenth target. Each switch trigger sends a click to the next target on the list. The list is recycled aftere the last recorded target is clicked. Alt-z resets the list. </p>
    <p><a id="other 3 triggers"><strong>Those Other Switch Triggers:</strong></a></p>
    <p>The other 3 Switch Trigger inputs operate as simple key/click sequence
      re-mappers. By setting a custom key sequence for any input, a user can
      issue a long sequence of keys and clicks with a single switch activation.
    </p>
    <p>Note that the leftmost 2 triggers take precedence of the other 3. In any
      case, avoid using the same definitions for more than 1 trigger, except for
      'none'- the no trigger setting.&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="left"><a id="set custom msgs"><strong>Define Custom Key Sequences</strong></a>:
      Below the "Set Seq #" buttons is a text field into which you can type
      anything you want. When you click the Set Seq # button the contents of the
      text field is assigned to its associated switch trigger. Custom messages
      can contain special characters like Tab and arrow keys. These characters
      must be enclosed in braces as in <strong>{Backspace}</strong> for the
      backspace key, and <strong>{Left}</strong> for the left arrow key. You
      can also include key combos using special modifiers&nbsp; as in<strong> ^a</strong>
      for issuing Crtl-A. The special modifiers include:</p>
    <p align="left"> ! = Alt<br>
    </p>
    <p align="left"># = Win <br>
    </p>
    <p align="left">+&nbsp; = Shift</p>
    <p align="left">^ = Control</p>
    <p align="left">For example: <strong>^p{Enter} </strong>opens the print
      dialog and prints the open document in many programs.&nbsp; Add a space to
      the end of a phrase like this: <strong>This is my phrase{space}</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="left">Here is more complex example from the setup "Word Helper for
      WordTalk":<span style="font-weight: bold;"> ^a!of^s25{Enter}{Left}&nbsp; </span>which
      has the effect of setting the font size of an entire document in Microsoft
      Word 2003 to 25. This custom message can be translated as a sequence of
      keyboard commands: <strong>c</strong><strong>tr</strong><strong>l-a</strong>
      (select all) <strong>alt-</strong><strong>o</strong> (select format menu)
      <strong>f </strong>(select font) <strong>ctrl-s</strong> (select size) <strong>25</strong>
      (set size to 25) <strong>Enter </strong>(apply change to font) <strong>Left</strong>
      (press left arrow to deselect all).<br>
    </p>
    You can also send clicks as in <span style="font-weight: bold;">{Click 2}</span>
    which has the effect of sending a double click. <br>
    <br>
    SwitchWedge was created using the incredibly useful but not-so-user-friendly
    Autohotkey to perform its magic. Let me know if you are having trouble
    getting some a custom message to do what you want, and I will suggest a
    solution, if it is possible. There is much more detail at the Autohotkey
    website on what you can have a button <b>"send"</b> which can be found
    here: <a href="http://www.autohotkey.com/docs/commands/Send.htm">http://www.autohotkey.com/docs/commands/Send.htm
      . </a>
    <p><a id="saving setups"><strong>Saving Setups</strong></a>:</p>
    <p>You can save named setups to make reconfiguring SwitchWedge for favorite
      applications easy and quick. The setups are stored in a standard text file
      called 'sw.ini' that can be easily edited with NotePad. The setup file,
      sw.ini, must be in the same folder as SwitchWedge.exe. Otherwise when you
      open SwitchWedge you will encounter a flurry of error messages.
      SwitchWedge will eventually open and generate a valid sw.ini&nbsp; file
      with default values. You can edit the sw.ini file with NotePad as
      described in detail below.</p>
    <p><a id="shortcuts and tips"><strong>Keyboard Shortcuts and other tips</strong></a>:</p>
    <p> Press ~&nbsp; or ` to Suspend or Resume&nbsp; input triggers for
      SwitchWedge. This will allow you to use your keyboard, or mouse for their
      normal purposes. SwitchWedge does not need to be resumed to record
      hotspots. You can optionally set SwitchWedge to start with triggers
      suspended by checking the Start SW Off box. Activating (Resuming) the
      triggers will also minimize the setup screen. Suspending triggers will
      restore the setup screen.</p>
    <p>Press Alt-s key combo to shrink or expand the SwitchWedge window. </p>
    <p>Press the Alt-t key combo to capture the title of the active window, and
      to optionally save a setup with this name.</p>
    <p>Press the "Help" button in SwitchWedge to open this window.</p>
    <p>The <span style="font-weight: bold;">Slow Send</span> check box
      activates a slower rate of sending keystrokes from custom messages. This
      can help by allowing some time between keystrokes, giving programs a
      chance to process each keystroke. Keystroke sequences may not get
      processed properly if they are sent too fast.</p>
    <p><a id="editing setup"><strong>Editing sw.ini (the setup file)</strong></a>:</p>
    <p>SwitchWedge stores its settings in a simple text file called sw.ini which
      will open in notepad if you double click it.&nbsp; Every setting and
      aspect of SwitchWedge has an entry in sw.ini that looks like an equation
      consisting of a parameter name and a value for that parameter. For
      example, the name = value associated with mouse speed could be an entry
      like: mouseSpeed=100</p>
    <p>There are 40, or so, entries that define all the parameters for any given
      setup. The beginning of each different saved setup section is denoted in
      the sw.ini file as a line that has square brackets around the setup name,
      for example: [swsettings]&nbsp;&nbsp; (The [swsettings] section of the
      sw.ini file is the only section that is necessary for starting SwitchWedge
      without error messages. )</p>
    <p>You can&nbsp; edit any line of the sw.ini file using Notepad, and even
      delete entire saved setups. You can change any value, but if you change
      any names, you will surely encounter errors when SwitchWedge re-opens that
      setup.</p>
    <p> <span style="font-style: italic;">At this point the only way to
        eliminate unwanted saved setups is use a text editor like Notepad to
        delete the section beginning with the line with the square bracketed
        setup name and ending with the last line entry for that section that has
        the definition for slowsend.</span> </p>
    <p>Just make sure you always have a complete [swsettings] section.</p>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <p><a id="sw and file partners"><strong>SwitchWedge and its associated files</strong></a>:</p>
    <p>SwitchWedge is packaged as a zip file consisting of four files:
      SwitchWedge.exe, the SwitchWedge program; sw.ini, the setup file;&nbsp;
      SwitchWedgeHelp.html, and switchwedge_.jpg the help document and picture
      resource.</p>
    <p>All four files must be located in the same folder for everything to work
      properly.</p>
