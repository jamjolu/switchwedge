<p><strong>What Does SwitchWedge Do</strong>?</p>
<p>SwitchWedge can enhance accessibility to many programs and
websites, and it can greatly increase the utility of common switch
interfaces such as keyboard emulators like the DJ Switch Interface
Pro, adapted mice, or adapted joysticks/gamepads. SwitchWedge
supports up to 5 switches, and offers enhancements like mouse
control, spot scanning and other features that the typical switch
interface itself does not offer.</p>

<p>The leftmost column of labels describes what the row of button(s)
to the right are for.&nbsp; The topmost label, &quot;<strong>Operating
As</strong>,&quot; defines an operating mode for the two leftmost
<strong>Switch Triggers</strong> (switch interface inputs.)&nbsp;
These operating modes&nbsp; provide the active features that
SwitchWedge offers, and they pertain only to the two leftmost
triggers as denoted by the box surrounding those buttons. You can
choose from the <strong>Switch Trigger</strong> drop down menus which
standard switch interface inputs, adapted mouse inputs, or joystick
buttons will act to initiate the actions of SwitchWedge. You can also
choose 'none' as a Switch Trigger to define that trigger as
inactive.&nbsp; The other three <strong>Switch Triggers</strong>
(rounding out the other three switch inputs on many switch
interfaces) can be redefined to send key sequences as described below
in the section: <a href="#set%20custom%20msgs"><b>Define Custom Key
Sequences</b></a>. The row of drop down menus labeled <strong>Key
Seq. Sent</strong> represents keystrokes, custom key sequences, or
mouse clicks that are sent to the active application as a result of a
user hitting a <strong>Switch Trigger</strong>. Depending on the
operating mode, the <strong>Key Seq. Sent</strong> menus may be
hidden. For example, in <strong>Spot Scan</strong> mode, because only
mouse click is sent during spot scanning the <strong>Key Seq. Sent</strong>
options are hidden for leftmost 2 triggers.</p>
<p>Whenever you change operating modes SwitchWedge will open a help
window to remind you of how to use that mode.</p>
<p>Whenever you change any of SwitchWedge's settings those changes
are automatically saved in a file that accompanies SwitchWedge
called, sw.ini.</p>
<p><br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p><a name="operating Modes"></a><strong>What are the different
operating modes</strong>?</p>
<p>1. - <strong>Single Switch</strong> scanning - the first switch
activation repeatedly sends a user defined keystroke associated with
the leftmost&nbsp; switch trigger to the active application at the
<strong>Scan Rate</strong> (in seconds) to highlight items. A second
activation of the same switch sends the next-to-leftmost user defined
keystroke to the active application to select the highlighted item.
Either of the leftmost triggers will initiate and control the scan
sequence. In many browsers a sequence of Tab keys will move the focus
around clickable links on a page and Spacebar will select the&nbsp;
link that has the focus and follow it just the same as clicking on
it,</p>
<p>2. - <strong>Two Switch</strong> scanning-&nbsp; The user uses
separate switches, one to issue a sequence to highlight an item and
one to select an item.</p>
<p>3. - <strong>One Click</strong> - the switch activation sends a
<i>click</i> to a user defined target. <i>Subsequent switch hits are
ignored during the</i> <b>Mask Time</b> <i>interval that follows the
initial trigger</i>. Either of the leftmost triggers can initiate the
click action. The click target is defined by hovering the mouse
cursor over the intended target and pressing the Alt-1 key combo.
(Press and hold the Win key, and then tap the 1 key.) This mode is
good for moderating a user who may hit a switch multiple times when
once is enough, like in a PowerPoint slide show.</p>
<p>4. - <strong>Two Click</strong> - The trigger sends a click at a
first target and then <i>after</i> the <strong>Scan Rate</strong>
interval, a second click to a second target. <i>Subsequent triggers
are ignored during the</i> Mask Time <i>interval that follows the
initial trigger</i>. Either of the leftmost triggers can initiate the
click action. The first click target is defined by hovering the mouse
cursor over the intended target and pressing the Alt-1 key combo, and
the second click target is recorded similarly using the Alt-2 key
combo. This mode is good for creating a cause/effect activity for a
user using something like YouTube where the switch hit starts a video
and and the automatic second click will pause it after the Scan Rate
interval, and hopefully encouraging the user to keep the activity
going by hitting their switch when the activity stops.</p>
<p>5. -<strong> Scan Mouse 1</strong> - This mode offers users a good
deal of control over the mouse cursor in any program. The trigger
initiates a sequence of tool tips that appear near the mouse cursor
at the <strong>Scan Rate</strong> which describe mouse actions -
either mouse moves: up, right, down, and left; or mouse clicks:
click, double click, right click, and drag. The mouse cursor will
move at a rate defined by the <strong>Mouse Speed</strong> drop down
menu where <i>smaller</i> numbers yield a faster movement. 100 is a
good medium slow speed.&nbsp; Either of the leftmost triggers can
initiate scan mouse.</p>
<p>6. - <strong>Scan Mouse 2</strong> - Same as Scan Mouse 1 but adds
the possibility of auditory support for scanning by copying the tool
tip text to the clipboard where a helper program like TTSReader,
SpeakEasy, Orato, ClipSpeak, or Deskbot can read it out loud. Free
clipboard text-to-speech are easily found on the Internet. Either of
the leftmost triggers can initiate scan mouse.</p>
<p>7. - <strong>Spot Scan 1 and 2</strong> -Spot scan allows you to
define up to 10 hot spots that will be scanned in numerical order.
Identify the first hotspot by hovering the mouse cursor over the
first target and capturing the mouse position with the Alt-1 key
combo. The second hotspot is recorded with the Alt-2 combo, and so
forth up to the tenth hotspot that is recorded with the Alt-0 key
combo. Use Alt-z to clear the spot scan sequence. <strong>Key Trigger</strong>
defines which key is used to start or stop scanning which occurs at
the <strong>Scan Rate</strong>. Either leftmost trigger can start the
scan which sequentially positions the mouse cursor over each spot at
the scan rate. A second trigger stops the scan and sends a mouse
click to the last mouse position. <strong>Scan Spot 2</strong> allows
you to enter auditory cue text for each spot. The cues are spoken by
a helper clipboard text-to-speech application like TTSReader,&nbsp;
Orato or Deskbot which must be active before beginning spot scanning.</p>
<p>8. -&nbsp; <strong>Remap Mode</strong> - sends whatever message
you pick from the drop Key Seq. Sent down menus, including a user
defined <strong>Custom Key Sequence</strong> as described below. You
can set a Mask interval as well.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>9. -&nbsp; <strong>Click List Mode</strong> - sends a click to one
of up to 10 targets in a list. Each target is recorded in the same
manner as with spot scanning. Hover the cursor over a target and use
Alt-1 to record the position of the first target. Do the same using
Alt-2, Alt-3, and so forth to record each additional target up to
Alt-0 for the tenth target. Each switch trigger sends a click to the
next target on the list. The list is recycled after the last recorded
target is clicked. Alt-z resets the list.</p>
<p>10. - <b>2 Switch Spot Scan 1 &amp; 2 &ndash;  </b><span style="font-weight: normal">are
just like Spot Scanning, except that Switch Trigger 1 moves the mouse
cursor to the next hotspot, and Switch Trigger 2 sends click  to the
current hotspot.  Like Spot Scan 2, 2 Switch Spot Scan 2 also puts
user definable text for each hotspot into the clipboard allowing a
clipboard text-to-speech app as described above to provide an
auditory cue.</span></p>
<p><a name="other 3 triggers"></a><strong>Those Other Switch
Triggers:</strong></p>
<p>The other 3 Switch Trigger inputs operate as simple key/click
sequence re-mappers. By setting a custom key sequence for any input,
a user can issue a long sequence of keys and clicks with a single
switch activation. 
</p>
<p>Note that the leftmost 2 triggers take precedence of the other 3.
In any case, avoid using the same definitions for more than 1
trigger, except for 'none'- the no trigger setting.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><a name="set custom msgs"></a><strong>Define Custom
Key Sequences</strong>: Below the &quot;Set Seq #&quot; buttons is a
text field into which you can type anything you want. When you click
the Set Seq # button the contents of the text field is assigned to
its associated switch trigger. Custom messages can contain special
characters like Tab and arrow keys. These characters must be enclosed
in braces as in <strong>{Backspace}</strong> for the backspace key,
and <strong>{Left}</strong> for the left arrow key. You can also
include key combos using special modifiers&nbsp; as in<strong> ^a</strong>
for issuing Crtl-A. The special modifiers include:</p>
<p align="left">! = Alt</p>
<p align="left"># = Win 
</p>
<p align="left">+&nbsp; = Shift</p>
<p align="left">^ = Control</p>
<p align="left">For example: <strong>^p{Enter} </strong>opens the
print dialog and prints the open document in many programs.&nbsp; Add
a space to the end of a phrase like this: <strong>This is my
phrase{space}</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">Here is more complex example from the setup &quot;Word
Helper for WordTalk&quot;: <b>^a!of^s25{Enter}{Left}&nbsp; </b>which
has the effect of setting the font size of an entire document in
Microsoft Word 2003 to 25. This custom message can be translated as a
sequence of keyboard commands: <strong>ctrl-a</strong> (select all)
<strong>alt-o</strong> (select format menu) <strong>f </strong>(select
font) <strong>ctrl-s</strong> (select size) <strong>25</strong> (set
size to 25) <strong>Enter </strong>(apply change to font) <strong>Left</strong>
(press left arrow to deselect all).</p>
<p>You can also send clicks as in <b>{Click 2}</b> which has the
effect of sending a double click. <br/>
<br/>
SwitchWedge was created
using the incredibly useful but not-so-user-friendly Autohotkey to
perform its magic. Let me know if you are having trouble getting some
a custom message to do what you want, and I will suggest a solution,
if it is possible. There is much more detail at the Autohotkey
website on what you can have a button <b>&quot;send&quot;</b> which
can be found here: <a href="http://www.autohotkey.com/docs/commands/Send.htm">http://www.autohotkey.com/docs/commands/Send.htm
. </a>
</p>
<p><a name="saving setups"></a><strong>Saving Setups</strong>:</p>
<p>You can save named setups to make reconfiguring SwitchWedge for
favorite applications easy and quick. The setups are stored in a
standard text file called 'sw.ini' that can be easily edited with
NotePad. The setup file, sw.ini, must be in the same folder as
SwitchWedge.exe. Otherwise when you open SwitchWedge you will
encounter a flurry of error messages. SwitchWedge will eventually
open and generate a valid sw.ini&nbsp; file with default values. You
can edit the sw.ini file with NotePad as described in detail below.</p>
<p><a name="shortcuts and tips"></a><strong>Keyboard Shortcuts and
other tips</strong>:</p>
<p>Press ~&nbsp; or ` to Suspend or Resume&nbsp; input triggers for
SwitchWedge. This will allow you to use your keyboard, or mouse for
their normal purposes. SwitchWedge does not need to be resumed to
record hotspots. You can optionally set SwitchWedge to start with
triggers suspended by checking the Start SW Off box. Activating
(Resuming) the triggers will also minimize the setup screen.
Suspending triggers will restore the setup screen.</p>
<p>Press Alt-s key combo to shrink or expand the SwitchWedge window. 
</p>
<p>Press the Alt-t key combo to capture the title of the active
window, and to optionally save a setup with this name.</p>
<p>Press the &quot;Help&quot; button in SwitchWedge to open this
window.</p>
<p>The <b>Slow Send</b> check box activates a slower rate of sending
keystrokes from custom messages. This can help by allowing some time
between keystrokes, giving programs a chance to process each
keystroke. Keystroke sequences may not get processed properly if they
are sent too fast.</p>
<p><a name="editing setup"></a><strong>Editing sw.ini (the setup
file)</strong>:</p>
<p>SwitchWedge stores its settings in a simple text file called
sw.ini which will open in notepad if you double click it.&nbsp; Every
setting and aspect of SwitchWedge has an entry in sw.ini that looks
like an equation consisting of a parameter name and a value for that
parameter. For example, the name = value associated with mouse speed
could be an entry like: mouseSpeed=100</p>
<p>There are 40, or so, entries that define all the parameters for
any given setup. The beginning of each different saved setup section
is denoted in the sw.ini file as a line that has square brackets
around the setup name, for example: [swsettings]&nbsp;&nbsp; (The
[swsettings] section of the sw.ini file is the only section that is
necessary for starting SwitchWedge without error messages. )</p>
<p>You can&nbsp; edit any line of the sw.ini file using Notepad, and
even delete entire saved setups. You can change any value, but if you
change any names, you will surely encounter errors when SwitchWedge
re-opens that setup.</p>
<p><i>At this point the only way to eliminate unwanted saved setups
is use a text editor like Notepad to delete the section beginning
with the line with the square bracketed setup name and ending with
the last line entry for that section that has the definition for
slowsend.</i> 
</p>
<p>Just make sure you always have a complete [swsettings] section.</p>
<p><br/>

<p><a name="sw and file partners"></a><strong>SwitchWedge and its
associated files</strong>:</p>
<p>SwitchWedge is packaged as a zip file consisting of four files:
SwitchWedge.exe, the SwitchWedge program; sw.ini, the setup file;&nbsp;
SwitchWedgeHelp.html, and switchwedge_.jpg the help document and
picture resource.</p>
<p>All four files must be located in the same folder for everything
to work properly.</p>
